This educational platform is a comprehensive tool for understanding quantum computing through interactive visualizations and data-driven comparisons. Let me explain its key features:

The platform is organized into four main sections, each offering unique insights into quantum computing:

Overview Section: Features a radar chart visualization that compares quantum and classical computers across seven critical metrics including processing power, error rates, 
and scalability. This gives users an immediate visual understanding of where each technology excels or faces challenges.

Performance Scaling Section: Includes both a 3D surface plot and an interactive animation showing how quantum and classical computers handle increasing problem complexity. 
The visualization demonstrates quantum computing's potential advantage in specific problem domains, particularly showing how quantum algorithms can outperform classical ones for 
certain tasks.

Energy Analysis Section: Provides a detailed 3D visualization of energy consumption patterns, comparing the power requirements of quantum and classical computers across 
different operational states. This section highlights an important practical consideration: while quantum computers can offer computational advantages, they currently require 
significantly more energy to operate.

Architecture Section: Presents a detailed comparison of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical computing architectures, including their processing units, 
memory systems, and key advantages.

All data presented is sourced from authoritative institutions (2020-2024) including IBM Quantum Computing, Google Quantum AI Lab, the US Department of Energy, and leading
academic research centers, ensuring the platform provides accurate, up-to-date information for educational purposes.
